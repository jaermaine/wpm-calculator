# **WPM - Calculator**

### Programmers:
##### 1. Borja, Romuel
##### 2. Domingcil, Jaermaine
##### 3. Romero, Lance

___
###### As computer science students, the ability to type fast or faster than average benefits us greatly
###### This project generates a phrase and the user must copy by typing the generated phrase
###### The program will then calculate the Words per Minute (WPM)
###### The program aims to imitate real-world typing, therefore it generates sentences instead of phrases
###### It also uses difficult words / uncommon words to further imitate the feel of real-world typing.

___
